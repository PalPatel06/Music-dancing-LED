# Music-dancing-LED
This project creates a fun sound-reactive LED system where LEDs "dance" or flash in sync with music or ambient sound. It uses a sound sensor or microphone module to detect audio input and lights up the LEDs accordingly.

âœ¨ Features

Real-time sound detection

LEDs flash or vary with music beats or claps

Visual representation of sound intensity

Customizable threshold and response sensitivity

ðŸ§° Hardware Required

Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)

Sound Sensor / Microphone Module (e.g., KY-037 or KY-038)

LEDs (single or multiple)

220Î© resistors

Breadboard and jumper wires

Optional: Transistors for controlling high-power LED strips

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

Analog input reading

Sound signal processing

Digital output control

Simple threshold-based signal filtering
